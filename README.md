This is my personal blog about how computers are built from barebones physics. I assume the reader has
enough knowledge of introductory high school physics (how electron, protons and particles at this scale interact
on a very high level a.k.a no quantum required). 
My goal is to walkthrough every step of the computer from the electron movements 
to modern day high level languages like Python. 
I am publishing these set of notes as I think they are helpful in building any important computer science education from a holistic viewpoint. Additionally, I want to add I use a series of sources - too many to mention at this point- that helped me learn the material along with writing these notes and so thank you to the many internet encyclopedia's and how to's that provided both information as well as graphics that I reuse in these notes.
